- 👋 Hi, I’m @MariQ99, but you can call me Marisa :D 
- 👀 I’m interested in everything about Computers, AI, and Web Development! 
- 🌱 I have taken classes relating to Java, mainframe, HTML, CSS, and Javascript! I want to learn more about Python, Ruby, and Artifical Intellegence. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to artifical intellegence and other simple projects too. If you need someone for a project, lets work together!
- 📫 How to reach me is by my email: marisagquinones@gmail.com
